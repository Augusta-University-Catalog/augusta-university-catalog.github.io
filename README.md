# Augusta University Catalog

This website complements Augusta University's [catalog page](http://catalog.augusta.edu/) by presenting its content as a naviguable table.
It relies heavily on the [Modern-Campus-Catalog-Scraper](https://github.com/Augusta-University-Catalog/Modern-Campus-Catalog-Scraper) python script developed localy. 

> [!WARNING]  
> This website is still under active development, and does not aim at taking precedence over the "official catalog".
