This course is structured to emulate a real-world working relationship between a designer (the student) and a client (the instructor). The course will be conducted on a case study approach and will allow each student to initiate their Senior Design Project. While it is an exceptionally rigorous exercise, it should be looked forward to as a great opportunity to explore areas of particular interest, to flex creative muscles and to define or solidify the student’s creative niche. The class is the beginning of a comprehensive project that utilizes all the skills the student has learned during the duration of their education in the program.
